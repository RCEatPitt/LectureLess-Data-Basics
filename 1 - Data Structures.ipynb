    "This lesson introduces [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) a library for data analysis and manipulation for the Python programming language. Pandas provides a set of data structures, *DataFrames* and *Series* for representing and manipulating data fast and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this lesson you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Know the three Pandas data structures: Series, DataFrames, and Indexes.\n",
    "- Understand what kinds of data can be represented in each of the Pandas data structures.\n",
    "- Be able to create Pandas data structures from vanilla Python data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data used in this lesson\n",
    "\n",
    "While this lesson does not use any external data files, there will be data represented as Markdown tables in this lesson. Be ready to do some typing because you will need to copy these data tables into your code. Don't worry, the data tables are not large. ðŸ˜Š\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson uses a snapshot of data from the [2010 Pittsburgh Neighborhood Profiles](https://ucsur.pitt.edu/files/census/UCSUR_SF1_NeighborhoodProfiles_July2011.pdf). The information represented in these data includes neighborhood name, the population, and the area in square miles.\n"
